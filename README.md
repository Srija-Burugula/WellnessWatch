# WellnessWatch

## Overview :
This project aims to build a web-based AI-powered health monitoring system that predicts the risk of chronic diseases using patient health records and wearable data (BP, sugar levels, pulse rate, daily steps, etc.). By leveraging machine learning models, the system provides early detection insights, helping users take preventive measures and improve overall healthcare.

## Use Case :
The system collects real-time health data from wearable devices and patient records, processes it through AI-driven risk prediction models, and provides personalized health recommendations. This solution is designed to aid in preventive healthcare, reducing the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and more.

## Key Features :
✔️ Real-time health data analysis 
✔️ Chronic disease risk prediction 
✔️ Personalized health recommendations  
✔️ Integration with wearable devices
✔️AI-powered decision support for preventive healthcare
